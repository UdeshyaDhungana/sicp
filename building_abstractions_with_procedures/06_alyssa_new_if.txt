Because built in `if` procedure, inspite following applicative order evaluation, does not 
expand second argument if predicate is true and goes with first option only
i.e. at some time, guess will be good enough and it returns `guess` without evaluating
second parameter

but `new-if` is a user-made function that doesn't have such property. Even though, at some point
guess is good enough, the function still evaluates second half, i.e. (sqrt-iter (improve guess x) x)
causing an infinite loop
