Let's say,

A = 10
B = 20
C = 30

P1: Exchange A and B
P2: Exchange B and C
P3: Exchange C and A

Each process consists of following subprocesses
1. Read first account value
2. Read second account value
3. Calculate the difference
4. Modify the balance

This can take place:

P1: Read A = 10
P2 (entire process) A = 10, B = 30, C = 20
P3 (entire process) A = 20, B = 30, C = 10
P1: Reads B = 30
P1: Difference = 20
P1: Set A = 20 + 20 = 40
P1: Set B = 30 - 20 = 10

Final:

A = 40
B = 10
C = 10

Balance is preserved no matter what because no matter what the difference,
the withdrawal on one account always appears on the another.
