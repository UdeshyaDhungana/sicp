P1 events:
a) access x1
b) access x2
c) new value = x1 * x2
d) set! x to new value

P2 events:
v) access x1
w) access x2
x) access x3
y) new value = x1 * x2 * x3
z) set! x to new value

significant event sequences and their results:
** (P1) refers to event sequence "abcd", (P2) refers to event sequence "vwxyz"
1. (P1)(P2) => 1,000,000
2. (P2)(P1) => 1,000,000
3. a(P2)bcd => 10,000
4. v(P1)wxyz => 100,000
5. vw(P1)xyz => 10,000
6. abc(P2)d => 100
7. vwxy(P1)z => 1,000

After serializing however, only 10⁶ exists
