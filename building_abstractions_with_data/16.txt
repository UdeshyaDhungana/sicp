I was not sure about this and searched the internet for it.

I found this in http://community.schemewiki.org/?sicp-ex-2.14-2.15-2.16

 A fiendish question. They say it's "very difficult" as if it's doable.
 I'm not falling for that. Essentially, I believe we'd have to introduce
 some concept of "identity", and then have the program be clever enough
 to reduce equations. Also, when supplying arguments to any equation,
 we'd need to indicate identity somehow, since [2, 8] isn't necessarily
 the same as [2, 8] ... unless it is. Capiche?
